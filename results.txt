Query: Get me all traces where frontend calls adservice which calls some other service. 


Strategy: Let the cluster run for 10 minutes so that there are some traces (being generated at 10k traces /s )


Tempo:
    Get traces that are 1 minute old (i.e., are at VM)(for 10 seconds): 35.3 seconds (compression??)
    Get traces that are 20 minutes old (i.e., are at GCS) (for 10 seconds): 42.2 seconds



Snicket++:
    Get traces that are 1 minute old (for 10 seconds): 2.9 seconds
    Get traces that are 20 minute old (for 10 seconds): 3.0 seconds

Running trace id query on VM vs GCS

Add the time constraint in all queries.
