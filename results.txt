Strategy: Let the cluster run for 10 minutes so that there are some traces (being generated at 10k traces /s )

Graph Query:
    Query: Get me all traces where frontend calls adservice which calls some other service. 

    Tempo:
        With Data Coming In:
            Get traces that are 1 minute old (i.e., are at VM): 35.3 seconds
            Get traces that are 20 minutes old (i.e., are at GCS) : 42.2 seconds
        With No Data Coming In:
            Get traces that are 1 minute old (i.e., are at VM): 9 seconds
            Get traces that are 20 minutes old (i.e., are at GCS): 25.1 seconds

    Snicket++:
        Get traces that are 1 minute old : 2.9 seconds
        Get traces that are 20 minute old : 3.0 seconds
