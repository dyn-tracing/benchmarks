    Get traces that are 1 minute old (i.e., are at VM)(for 10 seconds): 35.3 seconds
    Get traces that are 20 minutes old (i.e., are at GCS) (for 10 seconds): 42.2 seconds

Snicket++:
    Get traces that are 1 minute old (for 10 seconds): 2.9 seconds
    Get traces that are 20 minute old (for 10 seconds): 3.0 seconds
