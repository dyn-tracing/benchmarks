Strategy: Let the cluster run for 10 minutes so that there are some traces (being generated at 10k traces /s )

Graph Query:
    Query: Get me all traces where frontend calls adservice which calls some other service. 
    Resolution: Tempo brute forces, snicket has a folders index

    Tempo:
        With Data Coming In:
            Get traces that are 1 minute old (i.e., are at VM): 29 seconds
            Get traces that are 20 minutes old (i.e., are at GCS) : 42.2 seconds
        With No Data Coming In:
            Get traces that are 1 minute old (i.e., are at VM): 9 seconds
            Get traces that are 20 minutes old (i.e., are at GCS): 25.1 seconds

    Snicket++:
        Get traces that are 1 minute old : 2.9 seconds
        Get traces that are 20 minute old : 3.0 seconds

Plain Query:
    Query: Get trace with id <trace_id>
    Resolution: Tempo has bloom filters for search by trace id, Snicket has SBT index

    Tempo:
        With Data Coming In:
            Get traces that are 1 minute old (i.e., are at VM): 18 milliseconds
            Get traces that are 20 minutes old (i.e., are at GCS) : 230 milliseconds
        With No Data Coming In:
            Get traces that are 1 minute old (i.e., are at VM): 17 milliseconds
            Get traces that are 20 minutes old (i.e., are at GCS): 124.5 milliseconds

    Snicket++:
        Get traces that are 1 minute old : ??
        Get traces that are 20 minute old : ??
